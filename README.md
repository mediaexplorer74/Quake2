## About
This is my *veeery quuuick* W10M port of Quake2 project. :)

Main goal: do some testing/exploration of new "native" MonoGame.Framework.WindowsUniversal v3.7.1.189 package and try to aplly it for Quake2 xna world... :)

## Status of my Quake2 porting
- Init state ("project template"/draft; a few year(s) ago I found some very oooold Quake2 XNA solution at discontinued CodePlex...)
